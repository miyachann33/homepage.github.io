<h2>Profile</h2>
<p>
I am researching care robots. My goal is to create a society free from the physical and mental burdens of caregiving. Beyond robot development, I wish to engage in the IT-driven transformation of caregiving and the promotion of care robot adoption.

My hobbies include weight training and YouTube.
